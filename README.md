## Datastory

Please have a look at our amazing  [Datastory](https://fbarde.github.io/ADA_Data_Story/) ;)

This website and datastory were carried out within the framework of the EPFL course Applied data analysis, given by Prof. Robert West. We would like to thank him, as well as all his teaching assistants, and in particular  Akhil Arora, for their help and supervision during this project and course.


 If you are interested or curious about the programming pipeline that led us to this datastory, you are very welcome to take a look at our [Github repository] (https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2022-project-flagada22).
