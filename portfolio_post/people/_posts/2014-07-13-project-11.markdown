description: If many of the WikiPeople speak the unique language of the two main WikiCountries,English, an important part of the WikiCitizens also speak other (and various) languages. Looking at our real world, with its 7000 different languages and even more dialects, it makes sense that some of this diversity is represented. Similarly, if we remember that we use the English Wikipedia it is also not surprising that the main language of the people in WikiWorld is English.<br> If such a diversity can cause trouble for communication between WikiCitizen, this should not be a big deal; it is rumored that a new language is soon going to be taught in WikiSchools, the Newspeak.<br><br>
