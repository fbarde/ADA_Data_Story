description: The WikiWorld is mostly polarized between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, that gather most of the WikiCitizens. Many small countries still manage to bring a bit of diversity, but are not prized by the WikiCitizens. Also, note that a parallel can be made between the number of famous people coming from a country and the high centrality of these countries. It seems that famous people often come from central countries. <br><br>
