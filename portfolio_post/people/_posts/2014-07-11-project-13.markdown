This is not very surprising as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">christianity</a> is the world's largest and most widespread religion with roughly 2.8 billion followers, representing one-third of the global population.<br> A non-negligible part of them are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion">irreligious</a>.
