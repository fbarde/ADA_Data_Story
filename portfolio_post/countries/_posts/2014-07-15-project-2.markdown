description: The first word coming to the mind of the Wikispeedia gamers when thinking of the United Kingdom is the *Wimbledon Championships*, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament in the world ! *Flower*, which seems slightly lost wandering about all those political words, could actually be related to the Rose, which is one of the national symbols of England. <br><br> The place of the holiest city in Islam *Mecca* and *Arabic language* on the map might be explained knowing that Islam is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom">second largest and the fastest growing religion of the United Kingdom</a>.<br><br> We can link the capital of Sudan *Khartoum* to the *Suez Canal* by the United Kingdom through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis#British_response">Suez Crisis</a>. The region of Sudan was then a condominium between the United Kingdom and Egypt, from 1899 to 1956, when the Suez Crisis took place. Egypt is then invaded by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, who want to control the Suez canal and remove president Nasser who nationalized it. <br><br> Here is an interesting relation between two words on this map, *John Maynard Keynes*, world-renowned British economist whose ideas transformed macroeconomics, was invited as a financial representative for the British Treasury to attend the conference that led to the *Treaty of Versailles*. This deeply impacted his later work in economics and he predicted the devastating consequences of the astronomical war reparations required from Germany, which would later snowball to the outbreak of *World War II*, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Consequences_of_the_Peace">book</a> that established his reputation.
